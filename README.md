# Desktop Digital Clock

This project was started to solidy my basics in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
by building a different versions of time keeping tools. I started
off with a digital clock and have now added a stopwatch functionality.
I plan on incorporating a timer, and hopefully, an analog clock in the
future.

My Git and GitHub skills are also being polished through the use of
VS Code's built in Git Source Control.
