# Desktop Digital Clock

This project was to solidy my basics in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
by building a replica of a digital clock. I plan to add other
functionalities in the future, like a stop watch or timer.

Now I will also be incorporating the use of local/remote
repositories using VS Code's built in Git Source Control
